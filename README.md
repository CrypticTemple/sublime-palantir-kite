What is this
============
A set of Sublime Text plugins / completions for Palantir Kite XML files.  This should be a bit more lightweight than eclipse.

This may not work yet - I need to get a copy of the jars on the system I'm developing this plugin on.

Completions
-----------
* Ontology URIs
* Row processor / provider class names
* Parameters

TODO
----
* Strip default classes & parameters from public javadoc (for basic editing without needing all the libraries)
* Verify ontology output
* Parsing in background
* More completions (rewrite completions based on kite / ontology output?)

DONE
----
* Parse jar / javap output
* Cache kite / ontology for quicker loading
* Kite XML Language (for easier parsing of scope)
